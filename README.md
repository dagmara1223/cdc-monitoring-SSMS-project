# cdc-monitoring-SSMS-project
Full Change Data Capture (CDC) implementation on SQL Server tables, with data correctness checks and scheduled jobs for automation. I will be using only one server in such example.  

# Project Description ðŸ“ƒ  
One of the key advantages of Change Data Capture (CDC) is its ability to:  
- Transfer data in real time,  
- Provide control over which data is captured,  
- Improve efficiency by moving only changed records instead of the entire dataset,  
- Enhance data security through change tracking.  

In this project, I present skills I mainly developed during my internship at Orange.  
The workflow will include:  
1. Creating a SQL Server job for inserting any number of records into a table,  
2. Implementing several functions:
   - multi-use intelligent Insert / Update / Delete funcion,  
  - CDC to capture changes,  
  - A monitoring function to track modifications,  
  - A checksum validation function to verify data integrity
3. Finally, transferring the processed data.

### ðŸ§© Creating Main Table in SSMS and enabling SQL Server Agent  
Our first step is to open SSMS. Then, we start the SQL Server Agent by right-clicking on it and selecting Start. This step is required if we want to use jobs in our project.

Enabled SQL Server Agent should have green dot visible instead of red cross.  
Our next task is to create the main database with two tables: one as the source (from which the data will be transferred) and the other as the target (that will receive the data). <br>
We right-click on Databases -> New Database. Then we open New Query.    
You can find the SQL code that creates two tables here: ***SQL/create-table.sql*** <br>
Here are resuls for this part: <br>
